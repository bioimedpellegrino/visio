Unipath is an object-oriented front end to the file/directory functions
scattered throughout several Python library modules.  It's based on Jason
Orendorff's *path.py* but has a friendlier API and higher-level features.
Unipath is stable, well-tested, and has been used in production since 2008.
It runs on Python 2.6+ and 3.3+.

*Version 1.1* is a bugfix release. Most notably it fixes a Unicode
incompatibility on Python 3 under Windows (or operating systems with native
Unicpde filenames). The license is changed to MIT (from the Python license).
